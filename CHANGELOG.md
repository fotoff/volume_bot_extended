## [2.1.0] - 2025-01-22

### Added
- **Position Tracking**: Real-time monitoring and mismatch detection between positions and branches
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed position mismatch logging with branch breakdown
- **Sell Order Execution Tracking**: Automatic monitoring of executed sell orders and branch size adjustment
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better handling of partial fills and order state management

### Fixed
- **Critical Fix**: Corrected branch creation logic for partial order fills - now creates branches with actual fill size instead of order size
- **Position Accuracy**: Fixed issue where bot created branches larger than actual position increase
- **Sell Order Logic**: Improved sell order placement to only occur when position exists and branches are active
- **TTL Management**: Enhanced buy order TTL handling with proper position tracking for re-placement

### Changed
- **Branch Deactivation**: When position is zero, branches are now properly deactivated and their size is reset
- **State Management**: Improved state persistence with better branch timestamp tracking
- **Configuration**: Updated HYPE-USD settings for better performance (BUY6_STEP_PCT: 0.001â†’0.003, SELL_STEPS_PCT optimized)

### Technical Improvements
- Added `log_position_mismatch()` function for detailed mismatch analysis
